## Description

This project comes because is a project for the Coding Bootcamp at UCSD with Trilogy.

The goal of the project is to start with a web page that works, with the code the organization provided us. The code from the beggining worked as it should, but our goal is to improve it but keep it working the same way. 

The working web page is a Marketing Business  page, where you can find the different types of work that they specialize in. 

I started by analyzing how is that the code work, the different parts of it. One of the biggest problems with it was the semantics, the code used the same type of tag for every element in the page. Also the biggest problem of the stylesheet is that the code repeated several classes and ID's that have the same content (they do the same thing). 

Every assignment represents a different challenge for everyone. This assignment has the challenge of understanding how the code works, and why is behaving the way it is. Analyzing it this way it shows you that there are several ways to do the same thing while coding, most of the time it depends on the seleccion of the initital coder. While some might use different tags to agroup code some might use the same ones. The same goes while styling, some might prefer to make unique IDs for their styling but it might be of better to use classes when it repeats for several elements.
